          This year has been extremely challenging for everyone. The pandemic has forced many of us into stressful working dynamics, while the economic downturn has caused widespread layoffs and furloughs. But all hope is not lost. As we look towards 2021, we want to ensure that all of us have the right tools to succeed professionally. This is why this volunteer-led Career Advice Hotline was created.  If you’re a person of color looking for a job, interested in upskilling, or worried about where your career is going, this resource is for you. Sign up today to connect with a marketing leader who can provide insight and direction for your next move.
