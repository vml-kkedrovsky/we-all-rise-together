        COVID-19 is a significant disease that has impacted the globe. In America, the impact is acutely endured by Black and Brown communities. Recognizing this discrepancy, a group of leaders across the advertising industry came together on April 23, 2020, to address this &ldquo;trisis&rdquo;: the deadly three-way combination of COVID-19, economic recession, and racial injustice that has affected people of color. To counteract this harsh reality, we have sought to create an ecosystem that can instigate actions to restore our communities. Through shared passion and commitment, we came together after hours to talk, exchange ideas, and brainstorm ways to bring about lasting change in our health, mobility, and wealth. Today, it will truly take a village to save our communities.
