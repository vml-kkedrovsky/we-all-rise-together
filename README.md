# Build

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

To run a development server use `npm run dev` and to do a production build run `npm run prod`.

# Notes

The "build system" is simply [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) to some simple templating, [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, and [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to run the build.
