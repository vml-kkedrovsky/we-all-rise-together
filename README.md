# Build

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

To run a development server use `npm run dev` and to do a production build run `npm run prod`.

# Notes

This is a fairly standard [Eleventy]() setup, the only change to the defaults is using the "src" directory instead of "." for templates and content.
