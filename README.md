# Build

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

To run a development server use `npm run dev` and to do a production build run `npm run prod`.

# Notes

This is a fairly standard [Eleventy]() setup, the only change to the defaults is using the "src" directory instead of "." for templates and content.

One "icky bit" is that the page (and in the future pages) are built from content components to make the source file sizes more managable and hopefully reduce duplication. However, this means that Eleventy generates a page for each of the component files (the files under src/_content) that we wouldn't want to be available on the public site. For the reason the "prod" command defined in package.json deletes all the pages generate from files in any _content directory under src. There's probably a better way to do this but it doesn't look like Eleventy supports something like this natively, you either have to ignore the files (which also defeats automatic builds in dev, etc.) or you have to live with pages being generated by every file under src.
