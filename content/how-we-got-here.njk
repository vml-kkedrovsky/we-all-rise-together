CoVid-19 was a sea change that impacted the globe. In America, the impact is acutely endured by Black and Brown communities. Recognizing this discrepancy, a group of leaders across the advertising industry came together on April 23, 2020 to address this “trisis”: the deadly three-way culmination of CoVid-19, economic recession, and racial injustice.
